# Signals-and-System
Introduction: 
This python script performs signal processing tasks such as filtering and correlation analysis on input and output signals. It provides functionality to apply low-pass, high-pass, and band-pass filters to an input signal and then compares the filtered signals with an output signal to determine the best matching filter. 
Instructions: 
1. Input Signals: Ensure that the input and output signals are stored in separate text files. Update the file paths in the code to point to these files. 
input_file_path = "/content/INPUT-SIGNAL-X(t).txt" (Input File) output_file_path = "/content/OUTPUT-SIGNAL-Y(t).txt" (Output File) 
2. Environment Setup: Install the required dependencies: ○ Python 3.x 
○ NumPy (pip install numpy) 
○ SciPy (pip install scipy) 
○ Matplotlib 
3. Run the Code: Execute the Python script B22ME053.py. 
Output: 
● The script generates plots (optional) to visualize the signals and filter effects.
